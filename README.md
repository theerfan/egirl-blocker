Hide tweets from e-girls (girls with OnlyFans, Fansly, etc.) accounts on Twitter.

So far the Firefox extension works in the following Twitter pages:
1. Home timeline
2. Specific user profile
3. Specific tweet

TODO:
- [ ] Add support for chrome (coming soon)
- [ ] Also hide tweets in the "Notifications" page
- [ ] and in the "Explore" page
